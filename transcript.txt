| Description:    The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a professio |

|                 ed Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association  |
|                 of America, which became the NBA after merging with rival National Basketball Le |
|                 ague in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden in the borough of Manhatta |
|                 n and is one of only two teams of the original National Basketball Association s |
|                 till located in its original city. The Knicks were successful during their early |
|                  years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coa |
|                 ch Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearance |
|                 s in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 |
|                  and the team subsequently began to falter. It was not until the late 1960s when |
|                  Red Holzman became head coach did the Knicks begin to regain their former domin |
|                 ance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970  |
|                 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff ap |
|                 pearances however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.                 |
